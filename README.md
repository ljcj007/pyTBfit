# pyTBfit
Tight-Binding (TB) model fit of VASP calculated Energy bands

# Usage

To quantitatively analyze the band structures from DFT calculations, we build a TB model to describe single-layer octagraphene, multilayer octagraphene. By fitting bands  2
and  3 of the path from point  to point M, we get the TB hopping energies t.
